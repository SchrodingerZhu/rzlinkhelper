Reasonable link helper, good for you to analyze.

Features:

- [x] Works with [cmaker](https://github.com/SchrodingerZhu/cmaker) for CMake projects.
- [ ] Works with [libcallpass](https://github.com/cuhk-lambda/callgraph-generator) to show the function call statistics.


## Usage

``` shell
python3 main.py <JSON generated by cmaker>
```

or if the CLI is available on PyPi (not yet)

``` shell
pip install rzlinkhelper
rzlinkhelper <JSON generated by cmaker>
```

## Configurations

All configurations are defined in `settings.json`.

``` jsonc
{
    "callpass_library_path": "./libcallpass.so",
    "object_dir": "objects",
    "target_dir": "targets",
    "debug": true
}
```

* `callpass_library_path`: Callpass library path.
* `object_dir`: Directory where objects (.a, .o, .so) are generated.
* `target_dir`: Directory where call statistics are generated.
* `debug`: Debug mode which is more verbose.
